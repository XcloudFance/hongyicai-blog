## Experience
A lot of things happened in 2025, I will try to list them down in this section with timeline.

> February: Joined Infinity DataTech sdn.bhd as Technical Team Lead.


This is one of the biggest kickoff in the year. When the first time I came in the company, there wasn't any full-time developer even. What we have is just a bunch of interns, a bangladeshi (my friend) and some leftover codes.
And also I didnt know it brings me a lot of extra challenges and new insights while solving problems to ship a product. I basically include them below:
- Product Manager actually matters. So I decided to set one from existing frontend engineer intern. And it worked out seemly fine. So this year I basically learned a lot about product management.
- Kotlin Cross Multiplatform. It actually slays especially in the case that we need to integrate different VPN core library into different platforms. We managed to make it compatible with all platforms including Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android and IOS. Amazing.
- Node System. I designed this part in java, the last language I ever wanted to try in my life. We designed node systems with multiple abstractions to make servers scalable among different configuration. Now servers are able to serve as forwarders, VPN terminals and even you can arrange them backwards so the data come in from the outer servers into anywhere you want.
