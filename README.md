This is a template that serves as your academic homepage + personal blog page.

It is very welcomed to use this as your astro template if interested.

## Usage

`/src/content` is just like any other astro templates which include blog markdown files.
`/pages/index.astro` the main page.
`/data/publications.json` is the file that exclusively structure your publications, including dates (with automatic sorting by time), authors, links, abstracts and etc.
